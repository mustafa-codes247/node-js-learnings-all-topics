in class 21 , we learnt to install mongoose and crud operation using node js , express and mongoose

after writing something in index.js , we write 

(1)npm i express (it will install node modules and express)
(2)npm init -y (to install package.json important dependencies)(this -y is to yes all options)
(3) npm i nodemon (to reload the server automatically)

in node js importing is done in 2 ways 
eg:
1-common js: const Navbar=require "Navbar"
2-module js : import Navbar from "Navbar";
3-npm i nodemon
4-npm install mongoose

we will change common to module in package.json

there is package.json in which there is a thing in which we have to write "type": "module"
if there is not present

the we write  "start": "nodemon index.js"
and write npm start in terminal cmd
