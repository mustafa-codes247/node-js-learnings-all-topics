in these classes we learnt that 
    node js is
        - javascript runtime environment
        -it's open source platform
        -vanilla js and ES6 is used
        -.js extension (not .jsx)

we will create apis for crud operations
when we fetch premade api (json file), we cant edit or update it 
thats why we create new API for adding, deleting, updating data from that api.

in class 20 , we learnt to install nodemon so the server reloads automatically after each change


after writing something in index.js , we write 

(1)npm i express (it will install node modules and express)
(2)npm init -y (to install package.json important dependencies)(this -y is to yes all options)
(3) npm i nodemon (to reload the server automatically)

in node js importing is done in 2 ways 
eg:
1-common js: const Navbar=require "Navbar"
2-module js : import Navbar from "Navbar";
3-npm i nodemon

we will change common to module in package.json

there is package.json in which there is a thing in which we have to write "type": "module"
if there is not present

the we write  "start": "nodemon index.js"
and write npm start in terminal cmd
