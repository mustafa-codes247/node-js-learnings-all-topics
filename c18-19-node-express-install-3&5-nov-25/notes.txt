in these classes we learnt that 
    node js is
        - javascript runtime environment
        -it's open source platform
        -vanilla js and ES6 is used
        -.js extension (not .jsx)

we will create apis for crud operations
when we fetch premade api (json file), we cant edit or update it 
thats why we create new API for adding, deleting, updating data from that api.
